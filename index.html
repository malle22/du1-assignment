                <p>In 2013, Mojo magazine listed "Are You Experienced" as the greatest guitar album of all time.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>The budget for the recordings was rather limited so Chas Chandler (producer) and Hendrix completed
                    much of the album's pre-production work at their shared apartment.</p>
                <p>Chas Chandler, producer</p>
                <p>Are You Experienced sold more than one million copies within seven months of its release.</p>

                <p>Axis: Bold As Loves's scheduled release date was almost delayed when Hendrix lost the master tape of
                    side one of the LP, leaving it in the back seat of a London taxi. With the deadline looming,
                    Hendrix, Chas Chandler, and engineer Eddie Kramer remixed most of side one in a single overnight
                    session.</p>
                <p>Hendrix stated that the cover would have been more appropriate had it highlighted his Native American
                    heritage.</p>
                <p>Jimi Hendrix with Eddie Kramer chief studio engineer.</p>
                <p>"Little Wing" is one of Hendrix's most popular songs, with interpretations by musicians in a variety
                    of styles.</p>
